                <h3> CEO &amp; Founder </h3>
                  <p>
                    NEOMODERN was created by Michael Rubin. His pedigree swings wide, from making
                    movies with Bernardo Bertolluci, to premastering CDs for the Grateful Dead, to
                    developing the “paint-your-own pottery” studio industry, to years at Netflix.
                    But through it all he’s been a photographer. Last summer he left his Senior
                    Innovator role at Adobe to focus on fine art photography. And then this happened.
                  </p>

                <h2> Carlos Arrieta </h2>
                <h3> Director of Operations </h3>
                  <p>
                    Customers know Carlos as the “Senior Printmaster,” the most important job at NEOMODERN.
                    Carlos has spent most of the past decade leading the digital printing department at RayKo
                    Photo Center. He’s educated hundreds of fine art photographers in the use of Adobe
                    Lightroom and Photoshop, and in printing high-quality artwork. Carlos is not only
                    a teacher and fine art photographer, but an expert in historical processes like platinum,
                    silver gelatin and tintype printing.

                                                  NEOMODERN intends to become an important brand for “high-end” amateur
                                                  photography, reviving the hobbyist and printing industries.
                                                  In execution, and at first, NEOMODERN has built a concierge
                                                  photography salon producing museum-quality products for consumers
                                                  from their personal photos. Walk-in customers get their photos
                                                  optimized by professionals, printed and mounted, and even custom
                                                  framed, all in under an hour, and with their direct participation.

                                                  they want to turn into a beautiful piece of art. One of the photographic
                                                  printing specialists (a “printmaster”) will work closely with them on
                                                  the spot to edit, enhance and make the photo the best it can be. Once
                                                  finalized, it’s printed right in store, mounted and professionally framed.
                                                  Customers walk out of NEOMODERN with a museum-quality piece of art.
                                                  It’s not a print service—you cannot leave with just a print (it’s not
                                                  safe for the photo). And it’s not a frame store—the only works framed
                                                  are the photos printed there. And it’s not just an art gallery—the
                                                  photographs on the walls, whether by customers or by famous photographers,
                                                  are primarily there to illustrate great work and inspire. Some gallery
                                                  pieces may be for sale; it changes constantly.

                                                  NEOMODERN will try to print from whatever kind of image file customers
                                                  arrive with, but we will be candid about how large and sharp an image
                                                  can be from that file. A 12 megapixel image, about the full size
                                                  created from most smartphones after 2015, can usually be enlarged
                                                  nicely to 8x10; but the best prints will come from cameras like:
                                                <br />
                                                  <ul class="list-unstyled">
                                                    <li>Motorola Moto Z Droid Force</li>
                                                    <li>Samsung Galaxy S7; Samsung Galaxy S7 edge Sony Xperia XA Ultra</li>

                                                    <li>Google Pixel, Pixel XL</li>
                                                    <li>And of course, all dSLRs...</li>
                                                  </ul>
                                                These, and pretty much all later models, will be able to make prints
                                                as large as 13x19 and have the image data that can be manipulated to
                                                improve them as required. The truth is, there are many factors that
                                                affect the quality of the image and NEOMODERN’s job is to help figure
                                                out how good it can be. Can older digital images be printed? Certainly.
                                                Through the gallery, customers will see how content and composition
                                                rule, and frequently resolution and “perfection” aren’t the limitations
                                                people think.

                                                    Printmasters work with customers to make images print as good as they
                                                    can be, although the definition of ‘good’ is subjective and it really cannot
                                                    be done without direct customer interaction. Printmasters use Adobe Lightroom®
                                                    professional software to do image adjustments—which means they control
                                                    darkroom-types of improvements: exposure, dynamic range, color balance.
                                                    Particularly impactful is the more nuanced burning and dodging of parts
                                                    of the image: to strengthen most images the exposures of different parts
                                                    of the picture are brightened or darkened for effect. Most consumers have
                                                    never seen their images professionally optimized.

                                                    Important to note that this is different from “retouching” or literal image
                                                    modification. Printmasters will not add or remove elements from an image,
                                                    take out blemishes, wrinkles (or exes). This isn’t ‘Photoshopping’ pictures
                                                    to make people look better or different. Image optimization follows journalistic
                                                    guidelines of integrity: picture content is not changed.

                                                    The modernist movement in photography began in the early 1900s,
                                                    when 35mm film was invented and camera ownership became more
                                                    mainstream. Today, a hundred years later, film is gone and yet
                                                    everyone has a camera in their pocket. Still, it took until 2017
                                                    before camera phone images were of high enough quality that they
                                                    could be printed the way film was traditionally printed.

                                                    beginning, a new modernism— neomodernism—defined not by a
                                                    nostalgic return to film and chemicals but by a revival of creative
                                                    amateurs and hobbyists. Photography, now as ever, is about creating a
                                                    beautiful physical object, a print, that will stand the test of time.

                                                    The photographs printed are technically “archival pigment prints” and are
                                                    made using photographic pigments (as opposed to non-archival dyes). The word
                                                    “archival” means that the materials being used will not degrade over time (or
                                                    at least very very slowly). Other methods are notoriously prone to fading and
                                                    other forms of deterioration. We print on professional Epson photographic inkjet

                                                    The process of archival, museum-style mounting means that the photograph is not
                                                    compromised in the process—it is neither glued nor taped down. This is the
                                                    optimal way to treat important photographs; it allows the process to be easily
                                                    undone, and for the prints to be safely removed, if needed. The window mats are
                                                    hinged to the backing boards with linen tape, which is the way photographs are

                                                    NEOMODERN uses custom wood frames, acid-free cotton mat boards and tapes, and

                                                    Additionally, NEOMODERN uses flexible pins to fix the print into the frame
                                                    which makes it possible for the customer to easily release the mat and replace
                                                    it with a different matted photo.

But the real opportunity is in seeing what will happen when the service is made accessible for regular people. NEOMODERN’s customer, consequently, is any consumer, amateur photographer or hobbyist who wants to create a piece of art from a photo they took.

                                                    To make a photo larger than 8x10, which is often the smallest size that photographic fine art is created, but also not uncommon, you’d either need analog film or a professional quality digital camera, good optics, a quality sensor and smart compression software. In short, you’d need a DSLR, that is, until the iPhone 7 was released. Only recently has “professional quality” been in the hands of virtually all consumers in their smartphone camera. At the peak year of analog film cameras, about 40 million were sold; last year more than 1.4 billion smartphones with cameras were sold—a market expansion of three orders of magnitude; as old phones are replaced, the market for quality photo services and activities will increase. This represents a new and very large market, and a new market opportunity that hasn’t fully been recognized.

                                                    The collection at NEOMODERN is selected from hundreds of modernist photographers including Ansel Adams, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Elliott Erwitt, Andre Kertesz, Harry Callahan and Alma Lavenson. The works will be constantly rotated through the gallery to best demonstrate modernist ways of seeing and photographing the people, events, and things around us. NEOMODERN believes that any person’s photographic skills will improve just by spending time looking at the masterpieces that surround them in the gallery.

                                                    You walk into NEOMODERN and the first thing you see are photographs. Beautiful prints. You could be in the SF MOMA or the DeYoung. You might recognize some of them, and then there are ones you don’t because they were made last week by people in the neighborhood. Not professionals, just regular people with cell phones. These prints are on the gallery walls next to prints by Cartier-Bresson.

                                                    The first take away about NEOMODERN: it’s analog, but it’s not retro. While it demands that
                                                    images must be printed in physical form to become photographs, it’s not wed to the technologies
                                                    that created those images. There’s no fetishizing old cameras and celluloid film. You make prints
                                                    at NEOMODERN, but there’s no darkroom. It’s the future of photography with a direct connection to the past. No other company is doing that or recognizes the singular importance of this.

                                                    Michael Rubin created NEOMODERN. He’s the founder and CEO, although he refers to himself as “Chief Photo Officer.” His pedigree swings wide, from making movies with Bernardo Bertolluci, to premastering CDs for the Grateful Dead, to developing the “paint-your-own pottery” studio industry, to years at Netflix. But mostly he’s a photographer. Last summer he left his Senior Innovator role at Adobe to focus on his fine art photography. And then this happened.
                                                    <br /><br />
                                                    The first person Rubin brought in was Carlos Arrieta, officially the Director of Operations, but for customers he’s the “Senior Printmaster,” the most important job at NEOMODERN. Carlos has spent most of the past decade leading the digital printing department at RayKo Photo Center. He’s educated hundreds of fine art photographers in the use of Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop, and in printing high-quality artwork. Carlos is not only a teacher and fine art photographer, but an expert in historical processes like platinum, silver gelatin and tintype printing.

                                                    conversations about creating a number of NEOMODERN locations nationwide;
                                                    <b>and the collaborative service that goes on at the Union Street studio
                                                    will be taken online for web customers before the end of the year.</b> When
                                                    we introduce our shipping service, people everywhere will be able to
                                                    connect to the NEOMODERN experience. NEOMODERN looks like a gallery,
                                                    but it’s really a tech startup, just created in reverse.
